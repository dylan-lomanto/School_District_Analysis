# School_District_Analysis

### Overview
The client has provided me with reading and math test scores for students at 15 district high schools, as well as information about budget, type, and size of each of the schools. I have been tasked with merging the data sets and then determining passing percentages for each test and overall based upon school, grade, type of school, size of school, and budget. After the initial analysis it was determined that there were ineligible test results from the 9th graders at Thomas High School due to cheating.  I was resposible to eliminate the test results and student counts from this population and rerun the analysis.
